The Odin Project -> Web Development 101 -> Project: HTML/CSS

From the Odin Project's <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css">curriculum</a>.

Odin's more challenging version of re-creating a Google page - this time search results.

Odin links to a google search of 'build this site' which is cool because the task will always be evolving with google's latest design. Helps the student to see in today's design standards rather than something from years ago.

Excited for this challenge. I'm sure I'll get tripped up, but wheels are turning already on how to lay out the framework.
